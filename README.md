# Nuant FE Test

This project uses vite react-ts template which provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with ESLint rules.

It's been configured with Tailwindcss in case you want to use it Pokenode to retrieve the data of Pokemons

- [Pokenode](https://pokenode-ts.vercel.app/) (hint for the pokenode usage https://pokenode-ts.vercel.app/clients/pokemon-client) 
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

The purpose of the test is to implement an app that have the ability of :

- Search for Pokemon by `name` and the posibility to filter the results by `type`
  (User can search by name, user can filter pokemons by type, user can do both at the same time also)
- Display the search results with enough detail to be able to identify to which Pokemon each result belongs.(Name and a image would do)
- View more information about the Pokemon on a dedicated page by clicking a search result. (You can display Name, different sprites, weight, height and basic information, dealing with linked entities will be bonus point but arent really mandatory).
- See the previous search results when navigating back to the search page from the pokemon details page.

So basically something like:

Feel free to take any liberties with the design, and to use any library or tool you feel will help you accomplish the task. 

Remember this is a technical test so do this as close as you would work in our project or real life scenario, (a proper commit log would be useful to see how you approach and tackle the test imagining it as a long term project that you would do additional functionalities in the future)
