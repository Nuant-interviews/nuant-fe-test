# Nuant FE Test

This project uses vite react-ts template which provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with ESLint rules.

It's been configured with Tailwindcss in case you want to use it Pokenode to retrieve the data of Pokemons

- [Pokenode](https://pokenode-ts.vercel.app/) (hint for the pokenode usage https://pokenode-ts.vercel.app/clients/pokemon-client) 
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

The purpose of the test is to implement an app that have the ability of :

- Search for Pokemon by `name` and the posibility to filter the results by `type`
- Display the search results with enough detail to be able to identify to which Pokemon each result belongs.(Name and a image would do)
- View more information about the Pokemon on a dedicated page by clicking a search result.
- See the previous search results when navigating back to the search page from the pokemon details page.

So basically something like:

Feel free to take any liberties with the design, and to use any library or tool you feel will help you accomplish the task.
